Bug Report for Rhea Mae Edwards by Zhenggan Zheng

All test files are located in dominion/cs362sp16_edwardrh

Summary: The following function was tested: ambassador1. The Ambassador card has a bug where it does not discard the card that was chosen, nor does it force the other players to gain a card. This issue may be with the refactoring of the function and may not be located in the function itself. This bug is triggered by playing the Ambassador card. 

Severity: Medium
Priority: Medium

Below is an output of my test on the Ambassador card:


Begin Test for Ambassador 0:
