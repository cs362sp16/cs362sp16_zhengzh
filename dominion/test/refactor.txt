The cases of smithy, steward, village, council_room, and great_hall were taken out of the switch statement and put into the functions of int playsmithy(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int handPos), int playsteward(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int choice1, int choice2, int choice3, int handPos), int playvillage(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int handPos), int playcouncilroom(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int handPos), and int playgreathall(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int handPos). Then they are called in card effect with an if statement before the switch statement that calls the other cards.
