During my testing efforts in assignment 3, I tested adventurer, smithy, and great hall. I did not know how to get gcov to show the coverage of adventurer as a percentage since I did not make it into its own function. However I ran branch and line coverage and looked through the randomtestingadventurer.out file and it looks like I got 100% coverage for adventurer. I am not sure if that is correct or not. As for smithy and great hall, I got 100% coverage on both of these as they are very simple cards. It did not take long for the test to reach 100% coverage, I ran each test about 1000 times and it was almost instant every time. I think both smithy and great hall also achieved 100% coverage in their unit tests. So in this case both the unit test and the random test achieved the same effect and both were able todetect issues since the bug showed up everytime during the random test. As for the adventurer, it fails the test occasionally and it would have been a better test subject than the other two. I did not do a unit test for adventurer so I do not know how effective it would be. However, I predict that a unit test on a card like adventurer would not be effective as a unit test only runs one instance and adventurer only fails about 1/3 times.
