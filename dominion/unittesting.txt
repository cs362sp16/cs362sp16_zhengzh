In this assignment, I tested the functions of supplyCount, isGameOver, gainCard, and endTurn. For cards, I tested smithy, great_hall, outpost, and embargo. Initially I used the standard C assert function to verify the outputs of these tests, however, soon I realized that when testing things with multiple bugs, I should not use the standard C assert function since it will crash the program and will not allow me to catch other bugs. Also, using the standard C assert does not allow me to use gcov. I went back and changed my asserts to custom if statements, however, I only did those for the ones that actuall had bugs. When testing, I would initialize a game, then I would modify the game conditions so that I can easily test the card or function that I am testing. For example, if I am testing a card, I will initialize a game and then modify the first card of the first player so that it is the card I am testing, then play that card and then call functions to see the results. One of the issues is that since the code is so buggy, it is hard to know if it is that object that I am testing that is messing up or if it is elsewhere in the program. Or the bug could even be in the test itself.
